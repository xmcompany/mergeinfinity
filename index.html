      <h2>About Merge Infinity</h2>
      <p>Number-sliding puzzles have captivated millions since the original 2048 launched in 2014. This game builds on that foundation with an endless scoring system that removes the traditional win condition. Instead of stopping at a target tile, players push their strategic limits until the board fills completely.</p>
      <p>The mechanics remain elegantly simple: swipe in any direction to shift all tiles simultaneously. When two identical numbers collide, they combine into their sum. A pair of 2s becomes 4, two 4s form 8, and the progression continues exponentially. Each move spawns a new tile—usually a 2, occasionally a 4—adding constant pressure to an increasingly crowded grid.</p>
      <p>What separates casual players from high scorers often comes down to corner strategy. Keeping your largest tile anchored in one corner creates a natural flow where smaller numbers feed into bigger ones. Breaking this pattern typically leads to scattered high-value tiles that become impossible to combine.</p>

    <section id="guide" class="content-section">
      <h2>Beginner's Guide</h2>
      <p>New players often make the mistake of swiping randomly, hoping for lucky combinations. This approach rarely produces scores above 5,000 points. A structured method yields far better results, even for complete beginners tackling Merge Infinity for the first time.</p>
      <h3>The Corner Method</h3>
      <p>Pick one corner—bottom-left works well for most players—and commit to keeping your highest tile there. Your primary swipes should push toward that corner: down and left in this example. Only swipe up or right when absolutely necessary, and immediately correct back toward your anchor position.</p>
      <p>Watch where new tiles spawn after each move. They appear in random empty cells, and a poorly placed tile can block critical merges. Experienced players develop intuition for which moves minimize spawn risk in dangerous positions.</p>
      <h3>Building Chains</h3>
      <p>The real satisfaction comes from chain reactions—multiple merges triggered by a single swipe. Setting these up requires patience. Rather than immediately combining every matching pair, sometimes holding back creates opportunities for larger cascades that clear significant board space.</p>

    <section id="strategies" class="content-section">
      <h2>Advanced Strategy</h2>
      <p>Players who consistently reach 50,000+ points in Merge Infinity share common habits. They think two or three moves ahead, anticipating how the board state will evolve. They also recognize when to abandon a failing strategy rather than stubbornly pursuing a doomed position.</p>
      <h3>The Snake Pattern</h3>
      <p>Advanced players arrange tiles in a descending snake across the board. The highest value occupies one corner, with progressively smaller numbers winding back and forth through adjacent rows. This formation maximizes merge potential because neighboring tiles always differ by roughly one power of two.</p>
      <h3>Recovery Tactics</h3>
      <p>Even experts occasionally find themselves with a chaotic board. Recovery starts by identifying your current highest tile and clearing space around it. Accept that the next several moves might not increase your score—focus instead on restoring structure. Panic swipes in random directions almost always accelerate game over.</p>
      <h3>Quick Reference</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Anchor your largest tile in one corner and protect that position</li>
        <li>Maintain at least one empty row or column for emergency maneuvers</li>
        <li>Patience beats speed—think before each swipe</li>
        <li>Track your personal records and analyze what ended each run</li>
      </ul>
