      <h2>About Merge Infinity</h2>
      <p>Merge Infinity takes the classic number-merging concept and pushes it into endless territory. Unlike traditional puzzle games with fixed endpoints, this version challenges you to keep combining tiles for as long as your strategy holds. The board fills up fast, and every move counts toward either survival or a spectacular collapse.</p>
      <p>The core mechanic is straightforward: slide tiles in any direction, and matching numbers combine into their sum. Two 2s become a 4, two 4s become an 8, and the chain continues upward. What makes Merge Infinity distinct is the absence of a winning number. There's no 2048 finish line here. Your goal is simply to survive, score, and see how far the numbers can climb.</p>
      <p>Each session of Merge Infinity generates a fresh board state, so memorizing patterns won't carry you through. The randomness of new tile spawns keeps experienced players on their toes. You might plan three moves ahead only to have a poorly placed tile disrupt everything.</p>

      <h2>Beginner's Guide</h2>
      <p>Starting out in Merge Infinity can feel overwhelming when tiles multiply faster than you can combine them. The first rule is simple: pick a corner. Most successful runs involve pushing high-value tiles into one corner and building around that anchor point.</p>
      
      <h3>Essential Starting Moves</h3>
      <p>Begin each game by choosing your primary direction. If you pick the bottom-left corner as your anchor, your main swipes should be down and left. Only swipe up or right when absolutely necessary. Breaking this pattern early leads to scattered high-value tiles that become impossible to merge.</p>
      <p>Watch the spawn locations carefully. New tiles appear in empty spaces after each move. When the board gets crowded, a single tile spawning in the wrong spot can block a crucial merge. Experienced Merge Infinity players develop an instinct for which moves minimize spawn risk.</p>
      
      <h3>Building Your First Chain</h3>
      <p>The satisfying part of any merge game is watching chain reactions unfold. In Merge Infinity, setting up chains requires patience. Don't rush to combine every matching pair immediately. Sometimes holding back creates opportunities for larger cascades.</p>

      <h2>Advanced Strategies</h2>
      <p>Once the basics click, Merge Infinity reveals deeper strategic layers. The difference between a 10,000-point run and a 100,000-point run comes down to board management and risk assessment.</p>
      
      <h3>The Snake Pattern</h3>
      <p>One proven technique involves arranging tiles in a snake pattern across the board. Your highest value sits in one corner, with descending values snaking back and forth across rows. This setup maximizes merge potential because adjacent tiles are always close in value.</p>
      
      <h3>Recovery Techniques</h3>
      <p>Even skilled players occasionally find themselves with a messy board. Recovery in Merge Infinity starts with identifying your highest tile and working backward. Clear space around it first, then gradually rebuild your structure.</p>
      
      <h3>Quick Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Never swipe toward your anchor corner's opposite direction unless forced</li>
        <li>Keep at least one row or column relatively clear for emergency maneuvers</li>
        <li>Merge Infinity rewards patience over speed</li>
        <li>Practice the snake pattern in low-pressure sessions</li>
        <li>Set incremental goals rather than chasing impossible high scores</li>
      </ul>
